With this change, this document came to be known as the Birmingham Amended Statement of Faith (BASF). While nearly all Christadelphian ecclesias worldwide have adopted this amended statement of faith, a few ecclesias in North America still use the original Birmingham Statement of Faith (BSF) which has also been called "Unamended" or BUSF.

        <div class="basf-editor__content">
            <p>Some denominations produce a Statement of Faith and similar documents which form the core stance of the church governance. These principles are then communicated to the congregration through classes and sermons. As societal norms migrate through time, these principles and teachings often shift to try to match society.</p>
            <p>The Christadelphians are different. In this context, we have only one core stance: we need to read God's Holy Word with all sincerity and take this Word to heart. We take seriously the words of 2 Tim. 2:15: "Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth."</p>
            <p>The paragraphs listed above are not what Christadelphians teach, they are what the Bible teaches. The Christadelphians welcome all civil discussions and disagreements with those items listed. Our Creator wants us to discuss His Word openly in order to understand Him better.</p>
