        <p class="about-intro__text">
            Christadelphian is a biblical Greek word simply meaning "Brethren in Christ". Christadelphians teach and endeavor to live the gospel or good news that Jesus Christ taught and lived when he walked the earth almost 2000 years ago. By using the Bible as the authority, Christadelphians profess a faith the Apostle Paul termed "The Hope of Israel".
        </p>
        <p class="about-intro__text">
            We are a small group of Bible believers which meet twice weekly for our services in Thousand Oaks. Christadelphians put an emphasis on reasoning from the Bible and a faith based on proven facts. We believe in studying Scripture carefully and living according to its teachings.

                <p class="distinctive-card__text">
                    We believe in one God, the Father. Jesus is the Son of God, not God the Son. The Holy Spirit is God's power, not a person.
                </p>

            <div class="distinctive-card">
                <h3 class="distinctive-card__title">Mortality of Man</h3>
                <p class="distinctive-card__text">
                    We believe humans are mortal and do not possess an immortal soul. Eternal life is a gift from God through resurrection.

            <div class="distinctive-card">
                <h3 class="distinctive-card__title">No Devil</h3>
                <p class="distinctive-card__text">
                    We believe the devil is a biblical term for sin and temptation from within, not a supernatural evil being.

                <h3 class="distinctive-card__title">Conditional Immortality</h3>
                <p class="distinctive-card__text">
                    Eternal life is conditional upon faithfulness to Christ. The wicked will be destroyed, not eternally tormented.
